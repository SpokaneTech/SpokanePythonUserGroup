## Upcoming Meetups

### [Streamlit Deep Dive](meetups/streamlit-deep-dive.md)

_June, 20 2023_ | [:fontawesome-brands-meetup: Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-spokane/events/293590941/){target=_blank} | [:fontawesome-brands-youtube: Stream](https://youtube.com/live/0vqxzOwgaVQ?feature=share){target=_blank}

This presentation will focus on Streamlit, an open-source app framework for creating web apps. No front-end development required (unless you want to customize the CSS of the app). Anything you can draw in a Python application can be displayed seamlessly in your Streamlit web app. This includes interactive plots from libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly and all the rest. Streamlit also features typical HTML-equivalent elements to create modern layouts and multi-page websites.

We'll walk through the process of creating and hosting a Streamlit web app. The content of this app will be a set of tools to facilitate a tabletop RPG called Lancer. These tools will be character creation helpers, NPC generators, narrative guides and more.

Hosted by [Corey Farmer](https://github.com/MagnusGrave){target=_blank}.

**In-person and online.** [:fontawesome-brands-youtube: Stream](https://youtube.com/live/0vqxzOwgaVQ?feature=share){target=_blank}

So many of us have heard the phrases "dependency injection" and "inversion of control", but what do they really mean? How do these oft-repeated axioms help us create better, more maintainable software? Join us on Tuesday, October 17th at 6 PM to learn about these powerful design patterns.

### Coffee & Code

The first Monday of the month at 7 AM | [Indaba Coffee on Broadway Ave](https://goo.gl/maps/hAfFMFyaRMk)

Grab some coffee and write code, _together_. Note: we are meeting on the **second Monday** of the month due to a holiday on the first Monday in September.

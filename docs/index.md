## **[Python Meets Radio](meetups/python-meets-radio.md)**

Wireless signals are all around us, from WiFi and Bluetooth, to airplanes, power meters, and car key fobs, signals are absolutely everywhere. In this talk, we hope to help answer two questions: 1) can I listen to signals around me, and 2) how can I use Python interact with them? We will introduce this topic, hook up our software-defined radios (SDRs), and show how GNU Radio and some Python magic can work together to listen to signals and send your own wireless messages. By the end, you'll have what you need for everything from garage doors to overhead airplanes. [RSVP](https://www.meetup.com/python-spokane/events/288831420/){target=_blank}

Hosted by Maxwell ‚ÄúÍìò‚Äù Dulin & Jesse Victors

## **[Testing in Python](meetups/testing-in-python.md)**

_May 17, 2022_ | [:fontawesome-brands-meetup: Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Python-Spokane/events/284979634/){target=_blank} |  [:fontawesome-brands-github: Code Samples](https://github.com/python-spokane/testing-in-python){target=_blank} | [:fontawesome-brands-youtube: Recording](https://youtu.be/L-NX81YvqS4){target=_blank}

> ‚ÄúCode without tests is bad code. It doesn‚Äôt matter how well-written it is; it doesn‚Äôt matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don‚Äôt know if our code is getting better or worse.‚Äù  
> <small>- _Working Effectively with Legacy Code_ by Michael Feathers.</small>

If code without tests is bad code, then the first step to writing good code is learning to write tests. Join the Spokane Python User Group as we learn how to craft tests for our code!

<img src="/img/typing-for-fun-and-profit.png" width="600" height="337.5">

Why can you reassign a variable from a string to an integer in Python but not some other languages? Is Python a typed language? Is Python strongly or weakly typed? Does it using static or dynamic typing? What's the Typing module all about? Are there other options than MyPy for type checking (heck, what _is_ MyPy)? What is duck typing???

These are all questions I've asked myself at some point or another. In this month's Python User Group Meetup, we're going to dive into all things typing related.

The goal is you come out the other end of this meetup having answers to all these questions and more, and to be able to answer the question "Do I want to use typing tools in my Python projects?"

Do you want to learn about using a web framework in Python?
Are you tired of using Flask and looking for something more?
Have you used Django but want to try something new?

Then join us Tuesday, May 18th to learn about how to get started with one of the fastest-growing Python web frameworks, FastAPI! According to the 2020 Python Developers Survey, FastAPI is the third most popular web framework.

https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python-type hints.

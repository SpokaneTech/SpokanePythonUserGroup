## About
-->
**Description:**

Join us for an engaging and hands-on double-down session with the Python User Group and our Rustaceans friends from the Spokane Rust group as we dive into building a Command Line Interface (CLI) from scratch! This meetup is perfect for Python enthusiasts of all levels who want to learn about creating CLIs, an essential tool for automating workflows, data processing, and simplifying daily tasks.
We'll build a cool CLI in Python, and again in Rust to get a flavor of both languages.

**What to Expect:**

Authoring a CLI: Step-by-step guidance on designing and implementing a basic CLI tool in Python.
Interactive Code-Along: Weâ€™ll walk through the coding step by step, so you can build the CLI alongside other participants.
Insightful Tips: Learn best practices, modular design, and helpful libraries to make your CLI effective and user-friendly.
Q&A: Get your questions answered and discuss use cases with fellow Python enthusiasts.
Who Should Attend: Anyone interested in learning about CLI development in Python, from beginners to advanced developers. Familiarity with Python basics is recommended but not required.

**What to Bring:**

A laptop with Python 3.x installed.
An enthusiasm to learn, connect, and code along with the group.
Come for the code, stay for the community! We look forward to seeing you at this collaborative coding event.

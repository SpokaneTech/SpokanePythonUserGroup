Hello Python community!
This months meetup will be on a Wednesday 01/22. We are diverting from our regularly schedule date to join with the Spokane Go Users Group for an informal show and tell.
Have a cool project you're working on? Is there a new cool package/library/framework on your radar community? Found a tech vulnerability that's getting you down? Come prepared to share, or just catch up on what others in your community are working on.

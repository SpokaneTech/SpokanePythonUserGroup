# [Exploring Django ORM: The ORM for Python's Batteries-Included Web Framework](<file>.md)

_July 16, 2024_ | [:fontawesome-brands-meetup: Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/python-spokane/events/300506689/){target=_blank}

This meetup will be a counterpart to the Go user group's presentation, [Exploring GORM: The Fantastic ORM for Go](https://www.meetup.com/spokane-go-users-group/events/302005824/){target=_blank}. We'll be walking through what Object Relation Mapping libraries (ORM) are and why you should use them! For the Python side of things, we'll focus on Django's native ORM. We'll compare and contrast it to Go's [GORM](https://gorm.io/){target=_blank} library.

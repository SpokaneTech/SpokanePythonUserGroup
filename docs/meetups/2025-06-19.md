Hey Spokane Pythonistas!

This month, in lieu of our regularly scheduled Spokane Python User Group meetup, we're doing something a little different and encouraging everyone to join our IntelliTect friends at the Spokane DevOps Meetup!

They've got a fantastic event lined up. This is a great chance to broaden your skills and connect with other local developers, no matter what programming language you work with. Learning about deployment, automation, and infrastructure is super valuable for everyone in the tech world.

We'll be back next month with our usual Python-centric meetup, diving deep into something exciting from the world of Python. Keep an eye out for that announcement!

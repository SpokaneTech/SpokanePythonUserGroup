Are you interested in starting your next project in Python or Rust but unsure where to begin? Whether you're new to coding or looking to explore a new language, this event is for you!

Join us for a collaborative meetup between Spokane Python and Spokane Rust, where we'll guide you through setting up your first projects in both Python and Rust.
🔹 In the Python session, we'll walk through:

✅ Setting up your development environment
✅ Managing dependencies with virtual environments
✅ Structuring your project repository
✅ Using essential third-party tools
✅ Creating an example project from scratch

🔹 Meanwhile, our friends from Spokane Rust will cover the same foundational topics—this time in Rust!

This event is beginner-friendly, and no prior experience is required! While we’ll focus on helping newcomers, experienced developers are also welcome to join, share insights, and connect with the community.
Come ready to learn, ask questions, and meet fellow Pythonistas and Rustaceans. We can't wait to see you there! 🚀🐍🦀

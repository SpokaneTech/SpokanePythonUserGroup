## About
Take advantage of computer vision with Python and AWS, no ML skills required! We will dive into the Amazon Rekognition service and see how to use it with Amazon's Python SDK. Amazon Rekognition offers pre-trained and customizable computer vision (CV) capabilities to extract information and insights from your images and videos. We will use image detection and content moderation to identify and determine if an image contains inappropriate or offensive content. Join Stan the Snake as he slithers into Amazon ML with the Python boto3 SDK.

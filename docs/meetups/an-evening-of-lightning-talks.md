Come present on the cool projects you're working on! Lightning talks are short (5-15 minute), informal presentations! All attendees, online and in-person, are welcome (and encouraged) to present. Share something fun you learned about Python recently, an interesting story about a project you've worked on, or just some cool code you wrote -- or found!

Snacks, drinks, and **stickers** will be provided.

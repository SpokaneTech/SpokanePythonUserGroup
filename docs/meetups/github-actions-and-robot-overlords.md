Join us this February for two presentations and open workshop!

## GitHub Actions for Code Quality
David will show us setting up a GitHub repo with GitHub actions to run code quality automation such as linting and unit tests!
Length: 20 minutes

## Welcoming Our New Robot Overlords
Join Clayton (Data Analyst, AI Enthusiast) on an explorative jaunt through Azureâ€™s Cognitive Services in a demo designed for novices by a certified Azure Data Science Associate who has led the development of ML models in the Financial Tech and Insurance spaces. Warning: may contain pythons.
Length: 40 minutes

## Open Workshop
After both of our wonderful presentations, we'll have some time for open workshop! Looking for someone to rubber duck program with? Have an idea you want to hack on with a new friend? Bring a laptop or just bring yourself, but come either way. If you don't have your own personal project, come help someone else or tackle an Advent of Code challenge with a fellow Pythonista.
Length: 1 hour

What does a data scientist actually do from start to finish? In this demo, we walk through a full data science workflow using a real estate use case: finding the optimal house to buy.

We’ll cover data collection, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building, and interpretation — all with hands-on Python code. Along the way, you’ll see how tools like Pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization libraries come together to solve a real-world problem.

Whether you're a data practitioner or just curious about applied data science, this talk will bring the process to life through a practical and engaging example around real estate.

**About**

Come learn about MicroPython! Local Pythonista Keith Harris will be teaching us about using MicroPython and embedded hardware.

**MicroPython**

MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.

MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.

# Calling all Spokane Pythonistas!

<div class="callout">
  <p>
    We are looking for <a href="/speak/#submit-proposal">speakers to present</a> in 2023!
  </p>
</div>

## Speak at _SPUG_

Are you thinking of speaking at the Spokane Python User Group?  
Great! We're looking forward to reading your proposal!  

Never considered speaking at a meetup? We think you should! We love proposals from:
 

 - People who've never spoken before (we'll help get you prepared!)
 - People new to Python
 - People who use Python in their spare time
 - People who use Python professionally
 - People who want to talk about something that isn't specifically Python

What adventure are you having with Python? Did you build something  you're excited about? Did you learn something neat? What interesting  problem have you solved recently? What do you wish someone would have  told you years ago? Talks can be about anything that someone in the  Python community would be interested in hearing about.

Keep in mind that:

 - Talks do not need to be about Python, but your talk is more likely to be selected if it has some relevance to the Python community.
 - You can (and are encouraged to!) submit as many talk proposals as youâ€™d like.

Proposals will be reviewed on a rolling basis. **Meetups are every third Tuesday of the month.**

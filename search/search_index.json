This meetup is for you! In this session, we'll cover the basics of Django, a high-level Python web framework that follows the batteries-included philosophy. This means that Django comes with a lot of out-of-the-box features that can help you build web applications quickly and efficiently, without having to reinvent the wheel.</p> <p>We'll go over the main components of a Django project, such as models, views, templates, and URLs, and see how they work together to create a dynamic website. We'll also explore some of the most useful tools and libraries that come with Django, such as the admin interface, the ORM, the forms framework, and the authentication system.</p> <p>By the end of the session, you'll have a solid understanding of Django's core concepts and be ready to start building your own web applications with confidence.</p> <p>All skill levels are welcome, and no prior experience with Django is required, although some basic knowledge of Python is recommended.</p> <p>Join us and discover the power of Django!</p>"},{"location":"meetups/getting-started-with-django/#slides","title":"Slides","text":"<p>Full screen slides </p>"},{"location":"meetups/getting-started-with-django/#recording","title":"Recording","text":""},{"location":"meetups/getting-started-with-fastapi/","title":"Getting Started with FastAPI","text":"<p>May 18, 2021 |  Meetup |  Code Samples</p> <p></p> <p>Do you want to learn about using a web framework in Python?
